# EspoCRM_Modification
My custom edit for EspoCRM, feel free to use and adopt to it.

Hopefully it is not outdate, but I will add my modification here for EspoCRM.

You can use it as reference or guide or just download and extract the file. Hopefully it work for you.

I'm not a coder and have very basic understand and sometime I don't update it but it should work for v7+
